            Hey, Happy Kids Day and Anniversary mate. You've probably read the notes so I'm just gonna start. <br>
            This has been a phenomal experience. Though I won't say I'm super happy, I won't say that I'm tired of it as well. Is it working out? Seems like so. 
            To put it bluntly, you're not the best gf. But so am I not the best bf. We're just two kids who like F1 trying to figure this thing out.
            We've had our fun, like that one time we were exiting the KFC and you weren't moving so I acted like I was stuck in a traffic jam and you laughed the shit out.
            (That's a core memory now)
            And we've had our down moments as well, like the last two weeks. <br>
            <br>
            But I've noticed my way around those two weeks. And well, so to say, I've come to terms to the fact that I'm not the most fun, the most comfortable person you can be with. 
            You won't wrap your arms around my neck like you do to your friends,you won't laugh around me like you do with your friends, I'm not as compatible with you as you are with your friends but I've accepted that. 
            <br>
            Sometimes it just feels like it's not working out. Did we act on it too early? Were we not compatible? Is this gonna be a weird phase we had that'll make the rest of our friendship awkward? <br>
            But everytime we have a little convo, I'm reassured that it's not going bad at all. <br>
            <br>
            The thing is, your inability to recieve and give love makes everything more rewarding and satisfying. <br>
            These moments we're you're actually kinda loving are rare, and I cherish every moment of it. 
            Like that time where you made the move and we held hands. <br>
            It's sort of like, windowing in the middle of school. It's rare, and that's why you like it. <br>
            As much as I wanna hold hands and hug and all those cutesy stuff, I know I can't force it, that's why it's cherished. <br>
            <br>
            Yeah, guess that's that. Hope you had a great day, have a great day and I'll see you on Monday!
